# Laptop QA Script:

Here's a script that volunteers at [FreeGeek Chicago](https://freegeekchicago.org/) use to test and price laptops that they are working on.

James Slater, Aaron Howze (and possibly Ben Buckley) had something to do with the earlier versions of this script. It hasn't been modified for a few years.
